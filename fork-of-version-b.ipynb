The company, which handles a bike-sharing program, has more than 5,800\n    geotracked bicycles (consists of many types of bikes for different purposes) and locked into \n    a network of about 600 docking stations. Its users are more likely to ride for leisure, but \n    around 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.\n\n    Cyclistic’s marketing strategy ,untill now, relied on building general awareness and \n    appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible\n    was the lexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, fu l-day passes, and annual \n    memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or ful-day passes are referred to as casual\n    riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. \n    \n    Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable \n    than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, \n    Moreno,the director of marketing and your manager,believes that maximizing the number of\n    annual members wil be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that \n    targets al-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual \n    riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program \n    and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.   \n    \n    \n### You will produce a report with the folowing deliverables: ###\n\n    1. A clear statement of the business task: \n      - The company's (Cyclistic - a bike sharing company in Chicago) goal is to understand how \n      casual riders and annual members use our bike-sharing service differently, in order to \n      design effective marketing strategies that convert casual riders into members.  \n\n    2. A description of al data sources used\n       The case study use Cyclistics's - a fictinal name for the purposes of exploring the   \n       dataset \n      - historical trip data to analyze and identity trends and behavior of user's bike's usage. \n        The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license]\n        (https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is public data that you can   \n        use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that \n        data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ persona ly identifiable \n        information.This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card \n        numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have \n        purchased multiple single passes.\n\n### Key Stakholders: ###\n\n    1.

Conclusion:\n    The object of this case study is to answer to the business question: how do members and casuals ride the bikes differently. Based on the analysis of trend and behavior they showed through particular priod of the time (year, month, weeksays and hours) and routes, It will eneble stackholders to develope effective martketing strategy to convert casuals to members. \n    \n### Findings: \n\n   ##### Riding trend by year:\n    The bar char displays number of rides and the pie chart shows this numbers in percentage for the years 2019 and 2020.\n     \n    It seems casuals' ride trips, with increased three times in 2020 than 2019, \n\n        - The bar chart reflects increased ride trips in 2020 then 2019 for both riders.\n            * What is more important is the shift in the number of rides done by casuals which \n              increased three time than last year and a one third increase then members in 2020.\n            * It means member did not ride more bike than casual in 2020 (which was opposit in the \n              previous year),but it can certainly\n              be said it increased nearly two times than last year.\n              \n        - The pie chart show the percentage of ride numbers by member casual in bother together.\n            * It seem that number of rides done by members (69.77%) are considerably higher than \n              casuals (30.23%). \n          \n#### Rides by month: ####\n\n  ##### Average ride time: #####\n\n    Overall, average ride time is nearly three time bigger for casuals than member. \n    \n    Casuals, specifically, with stable maverage ride length in 2019 with just three time larger averages in february  \n    changed in 2020.\n\n        - Pich points: 89000m (January) and 7600m (february) or mid-winter\n        - Lowest points: 1250m (October) and 1200m (December) or during Fall and begining of winter \n\n    The everage ride time for members were nearly constant in both years but in 2020:\n\n        - Pick points: 1500m April to 1000 May in spring \n        - lowest points: 400m January and 450 (December) in the winter.\n\n  ##### Number of Rides:\n\n    Both casuals and membes have almost similar patter in the ride trips with small differences:\n    \n         - Most trips: May (90000t) end of spring to November (70000t) end of fall.\n         - Pick point: August (2800000t)\n         - Lowest points: December (30000) to February(20000t) in the winter \n     \n    By contrast, in 2020 members did more number of rides the whole year on each month than casual. \n    \n         - Most trips: Jun (190000t) less than (350000t previous year) to October (210000t) less than (400000t previous year) \n           or mid-spring to mid-fall. \n         - Pick point: August (320000t) less than (400000t prvious year).\n         - Lowest points: April (50000) and December (80000) to February(20000t) in the winter\n \n#### Trips by weekdays ####\n\n  ##### Average ride time: \n\n\n    Casuals spent almost four time longer than members on average during the weekdays in general.\n    \n    Average ride time for Casuals during the week: \n        - Pick points: 56m (Sunday) and 50m (Saturday) on weekends\n        - Lowest points: 42m (tuesday and Wednesday) in the middle of the weeks \n        \n    In contrast,the mean ride time (around 18m) remain stable for members in both years with slightly \n    larger mean rides on the weekends. \n\n  ##### Number of rides by casuals:\n    \n    Frequency of rides for casual has almost the same pattern in both years with a relatively small increase in the \n    second year.\n        - Most trips:  Sutarday (300000t),Sunday (250000t), and Friday (195000t) \n        - It means casuals use bikes more for leisures in the weekends.\n                   \n    In conrrast member mostly used bikes on the weekdays which is around 300000t in 2020 which is considerably reduced \n    from around 460000t in 2019). This means they use the service mostly for necessary task not leisures.  \n\n#### Ride by hour:\n\n  ##### Average ride time\n  \n    As a whole, Casuals spent three times more on average than members.\n    casuals:\n       - High everage points: 12am (100m) to 5am (100) at mid-night\n       - Pick points: 3am and 4am (190m and 140m)  \n       - Lowest points: 7am and 8am (30m and 50m) in the morning\n         \n     members:\n       - member's average ride time is almost stable in 24 hours (around 20m)\n       - but with moderate increased in the midnight from 2am to 3am (around 25m) \n\n  ##### Number of rides:\n\n    Casuals: \n        - Most trips: start 7am and decreased till 11pm:\n        - Highest trips - 11am to 8pm (around 100000t)  \n        - Pick point trips: 7pm (150000t)\n        - lowest trips: 1am to 6am (15000t)\n    \n    Members:\n        - Most trips: 6am to 9pm (around 140000t)\n        - Highest trips: First - 7am - 8am (250000t - 290000t). \n                       Second - 4pm and 5pm and 6pm (300000t - 390000t - 250000)\n        - lowest trips: 12am to 4am (15000t)\n#### By Routes\n  ##### Average ride time:\n    Casual: Top 20 routes shown by most used one in order. It seem most of the routs goes to recreational locations. \n\n## Recommondations: \n\n    based on the conclusion, it can be suggested that the executives and the marketing department should focus on the area or stations where casuals commutes more while using the service. They can also lay their marketing compign based on the time of rides they spent using the bikes. Fequency of trips they make by the bike can also be influential if taken into consideration in their marketing strategy. Both longer time of rides and the high frequency of trips can potentially increase the chances of converting casuals to member. These can easily be understood from different and specific time periods shown in the visualisations.","metadata":{"_uuid":"c4ea8ccd-7993-49ab-8469-9aa66e6cd2e7","_cell_guid":"7623af58-112f-4457-a92f-58dfe20e63cf","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
